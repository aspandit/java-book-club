# Algorithms Book
This folder of this repository contains code that uses code from and corresponds to <u>Algorithms, 4th Edition</u> by Robert
Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. Other code have/will be added to this repository by contributors that are not affiliated with
the aforementioned book and its authors.

## Setup
1. Ensure that a version of the Java Development Kit(JDK) is installed and the `javac` and `java` commands can be executed
in a terminal.
2. Download the *algs4.jar* file from https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/ to the *code* folder.
3. Run `source setup.sh` from the *code* folder.
4. Run the following commands from the *code* folder.
```bash
% javac book/algorithms/hello/Hello.java
% java book/algorithms/hello/Hello
```
You should see the words `Hello World!` printed on a line by itself. Other programs can be run and compiled in a similar
manner.
